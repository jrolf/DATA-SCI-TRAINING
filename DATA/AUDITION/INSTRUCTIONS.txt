Welcome!!

Your objective is to create predictive models for a set of output variables,
(dependent vars), provided a set of input variables (independent vars).

Included in this file is a TRAIN data set and a TEST data set.
The TRAIN data set includes instance records of both the input and output
variables, while the Test set only provides data on the input variables.
The TRAIN set and the TEST set each consist of 5,000 instances.

Each record has an 'ID' variable which is not factored into any of the models.
The input variables are  [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J]
The output variables are [W,X,Y,Z]

You will build your models on the TRAIN data set, and then apply your models
to the TEST data set to generate your predicted values for each output.

You will then submit a CSV file that contains your predictions for the
output variables that you are asked to model.

You will be judged on the final R-Squared of your predicted values vs.
the actual values for the data set.

Good Luck!!
(Although, in reality, luck will not help you.)

Sincerely,
